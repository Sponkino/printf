The  int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.  The
              precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
              appear;  if  the  converted  value requires fewer digits, it is
              padded on the left with zeros.  The  default  precision  is  1.
              When  0  is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is
              empty.

If  no  l modifier is present: the const char * argument is ex‚Äê
              pected to be a pointer to an array of character  type  (pointer
              to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but
              not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if  a  precision
              is  specified,  no  more than the number specified are written.
              If a precision is given, no null byte need be present;  if  the
              precision  is not specified, or is greater than the size of the
              array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.


.pp
Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT, or execute according to OPTION:
.TP
.PP
FORMAT controls the output as in C printf.  Interpreted sequences are:
.TP
\n"
new line
.TP
%%
a single %
.TP
%s
ARGUMENT as a string with '\e' escapes interpreted,
except that octal escapes are of the form \e0 or \e0NNN
.TP
%q
ARGUMENT is printed in a format that can be reused as shell input,
escaping non\-printable characters with the proposed POSIX $'' syntax.
.PP
and all C format specifications ending with one of diouxXfeEgGcs, with
ARGUMENTs converted to proper type first.  Variable widths are handled.
.PP
NOTE: your shell may have its own version of printf, which usually supersedes
the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
for details about the options it supports.
