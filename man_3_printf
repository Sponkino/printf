NAME
	_printf
SYNOPSIS
	#include "main.h"

	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
	The function _printf() displays output to the standard output stream 
	according to a given format as outlined below.

	The function basically writes using the write() function to output to the stdout.

	The function is equivalent to printf() function as provided in the stdio.h library.
	
Format of the format string
	The format string is a character string, enclosed within a double quote with a percentage
	symbol directly before the string.

d,s,i  The  int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.  The
       precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
       appear;  if  the  converted  value requires fewer digits, it is
       padded on the left with zeros.  The  default  precision  is  1.
       When  0  is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is
       empty. For the s argument the const char * argument is expected to be a pointe
       to an array of character  type  (pointer to a string).


	The syntax for the format string is:

	"%[the format]"
	%d:	Prints the decimal argument in the format.
	%c:	Prints the character argument in the format.
	%i:	Prints the integer argument in the format.
